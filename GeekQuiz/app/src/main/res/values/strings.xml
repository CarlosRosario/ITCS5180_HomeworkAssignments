    <string name="non_geek_description">There isn\'t a single geeky bone in your body. You prefer to
        party rather than study, and have someone else fix your computer, if
        need be. You\'re just too cool for this. You probably don\'t even wear glasses!</string>
    <string name="semi_geek">Semi-Geek</string>
    <string name="semi_geek_description">Maybe you\'re just influenced by the trend, or maybe you
        just got it all perfectly balanced. You have some geeky traits, but they aren\'t as
        "hardcore" and they don\'t take over your life. You like some geeky things, but aren\'t
        nearly as obsessive about them as the uber-geeks. You actually get to enjoy both
        worlds</string>
    <string name="uber_geek">Uber-Geek</string>
    <string name="uber_geek_description">You are the geek supreme! You are likely to be interested
        in technology, science, gaming and geeky media such as Sci-Fi and fantasy. All the mean kids
        that used to laugh at you in high school are now begging you for a job. Be proud of your
        geeky nature, for geeks shall inherit the Earth!</string>
